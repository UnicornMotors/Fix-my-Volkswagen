# Problem:

>8a.  Vacuum lines to/from turbo and n75 solenoid - these dry out over time and crack or can rub through.  It's possible they are clogged.  The n75 solenoid controls the turbo wastegate or VNT vanes with either vacuum or pressure.  b4 Passat - on firewall above coolant reservoir, a3 Jetta - on pass side near air box, a4 Jetta/Golf - on firewall above brake fluid reservoir.  Below are vacuum line diagrams for the mk4 ALH (below left) and BEW (labeled BEW) engines.

>8b.  Problem with the n75 solenoid, VNT actuator, VNT vanes, or vacuum lines.  Only mk4 and newer have VNT.  You should have already checked the vacuum lines, the below test will inspect the entire system.  Start the engine and through VCDS, click on "engine"-->"measuring blocks"-->hit "up" until you reach "group 11".  Compare Specified vs. Actual MAP.  This compares what's actually happening and being observed from the boost sensor (barring a faulty sensor/plug/wire) to boost the computer is requesting (what should be happening).  They should be relatively close.  If they are far off this normally results in limp mode but it could also be contributing to the problem.  If you have a mk3 you have a conventional turbo but you can still use this test to check the n75 solenoid, the wastegate, and vac lines.  However, wastegates are much less susceptible to sticking vs. VNT vanes.  The videos below show how it works.  The lever on the outside is welded to a lever inside the turbo housing.  This is how it moves the VNT vanes.  See the below videos to see how smoothly and free the lever should move.  It should not stick or bind at all.  Vacuum is being applied to the can, not pressure.
